This folder `bundle/extras/Sublime Text/Basiljs` contains a few build scripts for the text editor [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). This means basically that you can run a Basil.js script (or any other Indesign script) directly from Sublime Text. 

1. Copy the folder `Basiljs` (`bundle/extras/Sublime Text/Basiljs`) to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory e.g. OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Basiljs` or `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/Basiljs`
2. Now you should have a new Build System: `Tools -> Build System -> Indesign X` ... Select the one with the Indesign you want
3. Open a Basil.js sketch or any other Adobe Indesign script
4. Press `CMD+B` to run the script

Please note: You still need Adobe's ExtendScript Toolkit for the console output.
