basil.js
========

:exclamation: NOTE :exclamation:

This is a former state of basil's [develop branch](https://github.com/basiljs/basil.js/tree/develop). It is the last state that still uses the `b.` notation, before we switched to basil v2.0's `b-less` notation. While this is not an official release, it is the most feature rich state of pre 2.0 basil, so feel free to download this branch's [basil.js](https://github.com/basiljs/basil.js/blob/develop-v1/basil.js) file to run those good ol' basil scripts.

And btw. … if you made it that far already and feel adventurous, you can head over to basil's current [develop branch](https://github.com/basiljs/basil.js/tree/develop) and give the all [new basil.js](https://github.com/basiljs/basil.js/blob/develop/basil.js) a test drive, before it is even officialy released! It works without `b.`, comes with lots of new features and got rid of many nasty bugs on the way. Enjoy!

Please note: Big general parts e.g. random() of the basil.js source code are copy & paste
of the fantasic [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) by the Processing.js team. We would have had a hard time to figure all of that out on our own!
